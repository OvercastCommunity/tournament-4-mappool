# Overcast: Infinity Core

This is a repository containing all the maps that will be used in the upcoming tournament.

The maps will be getting updates until the end of the tournament, and will later remain as an archive.

The authors for all maps had either released their maps on mcresourcepile, or have given explicit permission to make them publicly available in this repository.

# Usage

To use this repository in your own PGM server, add the repository to the config:

```yml
map:
  repositories:
    - uri: "https://github.com/OvercastCommunity/tournament-4-mappool"	
```
